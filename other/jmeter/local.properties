##Â JMX stress test for BBData input endpoint
# Usage:
# jmeter -n -t BBData*.jmx -p some-file.properties -j out-file.jtl -l log-file.log

## 
# server properties
##

protocol=http
host=localhost
port=8080

##
# thread group properties
##

# number of threads
threads=4
# time between each POST, in seconds
period=0.1
# number of POSTs per thread
loops=100

##
# POST /objects/values properties
##

# The value sent is the same during the whole test.
# The object_id and tokens are generated by the script. Here is the gist:
# object_id = thread_idx (starting at 1) + id_inc
# token = token_start if token.length == 32 else token_start + (token_pad + object_id) trimmed as needed

# increment to add to the thread ID to generate the object_id
id_inc=0
# beginning of the token (fixed)
token_start=012345678901234567890123456789
# padding: repeated n times between token_start and object_id so that the total length of the token is 32
token_pad=a
# value to send in the body
value=1

# optional out file, i.e. where to save the results. You can also use the -l <file> option in the command line
out_file=
